# Duskers-Hyperskill
This is "Duskers" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Get more familiar with Object-Oriented Programming and work with generators, file handling, and modules such as time, datetime, sys, and os. You will also get a chance to work with simple text-based GUIs.<br>
Create a strategic game inspired by "Duskers" where a team of robots explores mysterious locations and looks for titanium. You will build it from scratch starting from the menu and adding the game hub, some animation, a few upgrade options, and some spooky enemies to spice things up.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
